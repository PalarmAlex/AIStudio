# AIStudio XAML Safety

- Never set `Style` and `TextBlock.Style` (or `Control.Style`) at the same time on one element.
- Before using `StaticResource`, ensure the key exists in current scope or merged dictionaries.
- Keep triggers minimal and deterministic; avoid overlapping triggers that fight over `Visibility`/`Opacity`.
- Prefer simple visibility logic for empty states; every output block should have a clear placeholder text.
- Do not change style-card animations unless explicitly requested; text/content blocks should avoid unnecessary pulse effects.
- For optional panels, bind `Visibility` to an explicit VM flag (`BoolToVisibilityConverter`) instead of visual hacks.
- Keep bindings one-way unless two-way is required.
- After XAML edits, verify compile errors from the changed view first; cascading resource errors often come from one malformed node.
